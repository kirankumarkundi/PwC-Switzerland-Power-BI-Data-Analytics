RECOMMENDATION
Based on the relationship trend between Churn rate and Tenure of Contract, the longer the Tenure, the lower the Churn rate, The call center is however recommended to focus on keeping their customers on a long-term contract.
Around 6% of Churned Customers did not have internet but 27% of Customers still with the company do not have internet. This is a disadvantage to the Customers and prompt action needs to be taken in order to ensure that all customers are satisfied and a higher Retention rate is achieved.
Regarding the Monthly Charges paid by Customers, a large percentage of Churned Customers paid low charges and are on a Month-to-month contract. They all left the company due to the unsatisfying services rendered to them. For instance, Over 50% of customers (Churned and Retained) do not have access to Online Security and Backup, Tech Support and Device Protection, and no Streaming TV or Movies. This could have caused the Customers to churn. This is also evident among those still with the call center, the majority have access to those services. In order to prevent Retained Customers without those services from leaving, the company needs to address that as soon as possible.
It is also recommended that the call center look into the Paperless billing system. The majority of the customers may not be able to utilize that method because the majority pay less than the average total charges and also a large percentage do not have access to the Internet.
However, if those without internet access can be provided access to the internet, there may be more customers who may stream TV and Movies.
